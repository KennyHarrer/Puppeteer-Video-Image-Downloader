# Puppeteer-Video-Image-Downloader

This script downloads all videos and images from a target site using puppeteer. I created this after I needed to download images and videos from a website but couldn't find a 'native' way to do this with puppeteer.

## Usage

- set targetURL to a url of your choice.
- change buffer limit based on files you want to download
- change types to download in download object
